# If Container = to a Jail Cell and Who is the JailerÂ then ðŸ˜‡
Investing for best practices is optional but the best practice will improve security, serviceability, maintainability and prevent conflicts of your software delivery process. Docker is a tool which helps to improve software Packaging, distribution and utilization best practices at low cost. Docker does this by providing simple tools to work with Containers.

If your system demands a dynamic scaling requirements, the containers become very and Docker can help reduce customer impact. Spin up and down containers with fewer resources than VMs.

For teams who uses CI and CD (Continues integration and Continues Delivery) can be more expressive on there delivery pipelines. More confidence on productions changes because container being tested on the test environment hold the same software and prerequisites which will go to production. This will bring fast and tighter iteration.

I have working on projects where local development environment takes at least three days to complete and if something goes wrong the particular development machine has to be reformatted / re imaged and each new developer has to go though 40 page development environment installation guild to complete the setup. but for teams who uses Docker for development environment setup can reduce onboarding  time and eliminate inconsistencies. Also each environment can be version controlled with versions each software update.

Several years ago we developed a software for Large Fast food that systems requires one week to build an new production environment (Requires to follow several installation guild which consists of 60 pages) for a new market. If Docker was there back then the Installation guild would be a single docker command with portable dependency.

Software developers knows Installation, dependencies and PackagingÂ , System administrators understand the environments (systems) where the application will run. Docker provides and expressive language for running software in containers and the same language allows system administrators control environment specific configurations and system resources. In addition to language docker provides package and distribution management. Which makes buildÂ , test and deployment is declarative and repeatable.

The first version of docker was launched in March 2013. You can imagine docker as your software logistics manager which package, ship and run your software. Docker lets you think on your software rather than logistics. Docker can be used to run multi node network applications like mail servers, web servers and databases.

Docker predominantly run on Linux but now Windows also supports native docker containers.

Docker is a tool which lets you to handle common problems like installingÂ , uninstalling, upgrading and running software.  And its not framework for building software or a programming language. Docker is an open source linux software and main sponsor  is  https://www.docker.com/

## What is Docker (OrÂ Jailer)?
Docker is a open source software which take a logistical approach to simplifying your experience on installing, running, deploying and un-installation.Docker is a command line tool and it achieves this by using the operating system technology call containers,which is a build in feature of Linux and lately adapted by Windows.
You can install docker by following steps in https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
