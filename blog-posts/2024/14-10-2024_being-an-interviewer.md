# Being an Interviewer

I have done interviews from 2014. Even though that I have more than 10 years of experience doing interviews, I still feel nervous and stressed prior to every interview. 

## Background

When I was at Virtusa, there several I get the interviews:

- For your own project - there open positions in your own project.
- For a project within your account - for a different project within account.
- For project out side of your account  - for project in the company but in different account.
- Proactive hires - Company hires individuals and they will not be tagged to account or project. In the later years proactive hires did not happened due to a company decision that every hire has to be billable from the get go.
