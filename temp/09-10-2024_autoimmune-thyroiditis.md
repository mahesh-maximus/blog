# Autoimmune Thyroiditis

What’s happening here is your body is making antibodies to your thyroid gland. More common among women. Over time these antibodies burn the gland out, so the gland will not function anymore.

## The Thyroid Gland

It is located at the bottom of the neck area near the collarbones or clavicles are, and sits infront of the windpipe also also known as as trachea. The thyroid gland is similar to a butterfly shape and it has a right side and s left side and has a small connector piece that’s known as isthmus.
