# Autoimmune Thyroiditis

What’s happening here is your body is making antibodies to your thyroid gland. More common among women. Over time these antibodies burn the gland out, so the gland will not function anymore.

## The Thyroid Gland

It is located at the bottom of the neck area near the collarbones or clavicles are, and sits in-front of the windpipe also  known as trachea. The thyroid gland is similar to a butterfly shape and it has a right side and s left side and has a small connector piece that’s known as isthmus.

### Physiology of Thyroid Gland

- Thyroid gland is regulated by pituitary gland in the brain. Pituitary gland sends a signal to stimulate the thyroid gland into producing thyroid hormone.
- Thyroid gland produces T3 and T4. Majority of the hormones produced by the gland is T4. Often times T3 is also converted to T4, so that it can actually act on the specific organ.
- TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). stimulates the thyroid gland. There is feedback mechanism where these particular two hormones act back on the pituitary gland kind of like inhibition to produce well regulated (not producing to much or too little) thyroid hormone levels

## Types of Thyroid Diseases

- Hypothyroidism (Hypo Thyroid condition - Under active thyroid gland)
- Hyperthyroidism (Hyper thyroid condition. Over active thyroid gland)

## Hypothyroidism

### Causes

- Autoimmune - body doesn’t recognize itself (Hashimoto’s )
- Iodine deficiency
- Surgery of the thyroid gland
- Thyroiditis - inflammation of the thyroid gland
- Medications
- Damage to the pituitary gland

### Symptoms

- Neck swelling - Goiter
- Weight gain
- Constipation
- Cold intolerance
- Fatigue

### Diagnosis

- Physical exam (Neck Goiter)
- Lab tests
    - TSH
    - T4
    - TPO Antibodies

### Treatment

- Goal - normal TSH
- Levothyroxine (14) mainstay of treatment
    - Long acting, daily dosing
- Liothyronine (T3)
    - Twice day dosing - short half life less than a day

## Hyperthyroidism

### Causes

- Autoimmune Grave’s Disease
- Thyroid Nodules
- Thyroiditis - Inflammation
- Medications

### Symptoms

- Neck swelling - Goiter
- Increased heart rate - Palpitations
- Weight loss
- Diarrhea
- Tremors
- Eye Disease

### Diagnosis

- Physically exam
    - Eye disease
    - Neck swelling  goiter
    - Reflexes, Tremors
- Lab Tests
    - TSH
    - T3 / T4
    - TSI Antibodies

### Treatment

- Anti Thyroid drugs
    - Methimazole
    - PTU
- Radioactive Iodine
- Surgery

## Two Main Forms of Autoimmune Thyroiditis

- Graves Disease Thyroiditis (Thyroid Storm)
- Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

## Graves Disease Thyroiditis (Thyroid Storm)

**Hyper thyroid condition. Over active thyroid gland.**

This very aggressive and very abrupt onset usually. Thyroid gland get huge and very beefy and starts making tons and tons of thyroid hormones. Some of the antibodies will also affect eyes and may be even your brain.

### Symptoms

- Heart rate is high
- Blood pressure is high
- Very nervous and anxious
- Eyes get bulgy

### Disease Life Cycle

Moves from having too much thyroid to not having anymore (which is a better condition). Post graves patients is gonna be hypo thyroid too (They are going to have hormone replacement).

### Medications

There are medications ?? and if the doesn’t work then use radioactive iodine to kill the gland off, then supplement thyroid hormone.

## Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

**Hypo Thyroid condition - Under active thyroid gland.**

This is the more common disease. In this case also you make antibodies to your thyroid gland but not as dramatic. Thyroid gland is not making enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms are very subtle so most of the time this is not discovered based on symptoms. Most of the time discovered during lab tests some people used to do on yearly basis.

### Symptoms

- Dry skin
- Constipation
- Fatigue
- Feel cold

### Disease Life Cycle

Gradually moves from having very little thyroid to not having anymore. Overtime these thyroid antibodies will burn the thyroid gland out. 

### Medications

Supplements Thyroid hormone replacement.

## Hashimoto’s or Graves from Lab test point of view
text

| **Autoimmune disease**  | **Lab Test** | **Lab Test** | **Lab Test** | **Lab Test** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hashimoto’s | TSH **↑**  | T4 **↓** | T3 **↓** | TPO **↑** |
| Graves | TSH **↓** | T4 **↑** | T3 **↑** | TSI **↑** |


**TPO** - Thyroid Microsomal Antibody, Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody

**TSI** - **T**hyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin

### Summery

Graves disease where your body actually has antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland into producing more thyroid hormones as opposed to Hashimoto’s the antibodies just prevented the actual thyroid hormone
