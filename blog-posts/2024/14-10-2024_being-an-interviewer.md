# Being an Interviewer

I have done interviews from 2014. Even though that I have more than 10 years of experience doing interviews, I still feel nervous and stressed prior to every interview. 

## How I get the Interviews

When I was at Virtusa, there several I get the interviews:

- For your own project - there open positions in your own project.
- For a project within your account - for a different project within account.
- For projects outside of your account  - for project in the company but in different account.
- Proactive hires - Company hires individuals and they will not be tagged to account or project. In the later years proactive hires did not happened due to a company decision that every hire has to be billable from the get go.

## Prior to the Interview

Regardless of whether the interview has to be done for my project a different project, I have to have the job profile. Once I get the job profile I got through each requirement. If there are any specific areas that I’m not then immediately inform the facilitator that I’m unable to take the interview. Then need to go through the candidate profiles and shortlist.
