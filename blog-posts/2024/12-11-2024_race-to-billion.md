# Race to Billion

I saw a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/VioxsWYzoJk?si=0j4sPqBwWh-vIOev) about Python vs C++ speed comparison and it blew my mind off. So i wanted to right something similar by myself and see.

I decided to use Rust (Instead of C++), Python and Kotlin also. 

Why â‡’

**Rust ?** (Compiled language) It a systems programming language just like C & C++, and gained more and more popularity these days. 

**Python ?** (Interpreted language) This year (2024) Python outranked JavaScript as the most widely used language on GitHub, across all work.

**Kotlin ?** (JVM Language)
