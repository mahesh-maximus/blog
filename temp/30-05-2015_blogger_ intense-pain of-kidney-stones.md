# Intense Pain of Kidney Stones 
I have experienced it, it's the worse pain you can get. You cannot run away from the pain. It's like getting stabbed with a screw-driver (with studded nails) to your side of the stomach and turning it very slowly.

Laterally I can feel every little movement of stone.  it's like something sharp is ripping through my body very slowly. The pain is caused by the razor sharp-edges of the stone.

When you have the pain only place you can go is to the ER. ER doctors gave me pain killers but that didn't help, I did not feel any relief, so they decided to go for the maximum, since I am having intense pain. They gave me 'Morphine'. Doctors took the signature before the injection of morphine and told me that I would fall asleep after the morphine injection. But surprisingly I did not fall asleep and just got a  little bit of relief, not the kind of relief as they told me.

After a one hour they took me to the CT Scan. As I was preparing for the CT Scan I felt a sudden sledge-hammer blow to the right side of my stomach, the pain is more intense than earlier. Somehow with lot of struggling I managed to do the Scan.  Minutes afters the scan my pain disappeared.

Two hours later I received the CT Scan report and it was a 4.4 mm stone trapped  in the right Ureter.
(Ureter connects Kidney and Bladder)

Doctor asked me to wait for about two months and if the stone does not pass, He would insert a stent to my Ureter to expand the path. and they would remove the stent after one month.

Doctor told me after removal of the Stent, the stone would pass, Hopefully would pass without any pain.

To Avoid such painful situations what you can do is to drink around 2.5 Litters of water every day. Also be careful when you take medications which consists of calcium.
