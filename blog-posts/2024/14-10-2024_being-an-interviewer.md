# Being an Interviewer

I have done interviews from 2014. Even though that I have more than 10 years of experience doing interviews, I still feel nervous and stressed prior to every interview. 

## Company Interview Process

This is subjected change. Since company policies may change time to time.

### Two Technical Interviews (L1 & L2)

When I was at Virtusa, they had two levels of  technical interviews and the final interview has to be done by an Architect. Usually level 1 interviews are done by most probably tech leads and level 1 interviews are done by Architects. But if the level 1 interview itself done by an Architect, then there is no requirement for a level 2, he can conclude the technical interview process from L1 itself.  Regardless of L1 or L2 is asked some candidates to join for another continuation session if I feel I need measure the candidate in some more areas.

### Final HR Interview

This will be the final interview and it will be held upon positive technical interview feedback. 

## How do I get the Interviews

When I was at Virtusa, there several I get the interviews:

- For your own project - there open positions in your own project.
- For a project within my account - for a different project within account.
- For projects outside of my account  - for project in the company but in different account.
- Proactive hires - Company hires individuals and they will not be tagged to account or project. In the later years proactive hires did not happened due to a company decision that every hire has to be billable from the get go.

## Prior to the Interview

Regardless of whether the interview has to be done for my project a different project, I have to have the job profile. Once I get the job profile I got through each requirement. If there are any specific areas that I’m not then immediately inform the facilitator that I’m unable to take the interview. Then need to go through the candidate profiles and shortlist.

### How to Shortlist Candidate Profiles

All the background checks and verifications about candidates qualifications and experience are done the HR prior to the hire. Usually HR will provide list of applications and I get involve another set of eyes to shortlist most probably the same interviewer that I’m partner up with to do the interview.

### Areas to look for:

- If I knows the candidate personally, the ask the HR to schedule the interview for another interviewer.
- First of all I look for the style and authenticity that the candidate has presented him self through the application:
    - Some candidates writes for example he has worked on ‘multiple threaded applications’, ‘dependancy injection’, ‘web API’, etc. And go on with writing about those technologies. Those informations are copied from web. And those applications are not authentic. But the candidates who his actually experienced with those technologies will blend the technology descriptions with business cases.
    - Check for any online references such blogs, GitHub account. If there go to them and read them in detail.
    - Look for the companies  and its reputation that the candidates had worked with.  If there are anyone in that company that I personally trust tries get in touch and get two know about the candidate, this is just a offline thing that do, since I’m an Architect, the final recommendation about recruitment is lies with me, so I’m trying get as much as information as possible.
    - If I’m shortlisting a particular candidate and still need some things to be verified officially such as why this person has leaving or leaved from a particular company.
