# Code Reviews to Drive Home the Point

## Background

I have thought several times whether I should right this or not, since this story is related to others who worked with me. And I have not told then nor got asked the permission to right this story, but anyway final outcome happened good way. So I’m writing this as a very hypothetical story and trying to convoy the abstract message. All the props and names are imaginary except the abstract message I’m trying to convey.

## Prologue

This particular client had a core near real time backbone system that all other enterprise applications depended upon. Let’s call that system **Az5**. Az5 was built upon a certain framework infrastructure and its licenses due to be expired and is not willing to renew the licenses since it is very expensive. We had already done POCs and cost analysis for the new framework infrastructure. And we selected a framework called **x22**. So client wanted migrate Az5 to new x22 framework. 

## Project team

I was working on client lead project alone with few other offshore teammates, and they well seasoned, high calibre resources. And client had onshore team with scrum team than we are part of. Client stake holder was hands on highly technical as well as his onshore team. Even though the main client stake holder is highly technical and hands on he is not involving with project execution apart from setting the project roadmap.

## Project nature

There were many enterprise applications with  state of the art cloud driven and legacy applications which were developed in 1980s. And many integrations among them.  

## Nature of  project work

I know things look grim, but all is not lost
