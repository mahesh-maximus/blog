# Should your team adapt RUST programming language?

# What is Rust

You probably have herd, A new programing language design among three big pillars.

Performance & Control | Reliability & Safty | Productivity
----------------------|---------------------|-------------
Full system control with no mandatory runtime services.| Statically guarantees memory safety and thread safety | Documentation, mature compiler and tolls, package manager, IDE & editor integration.

Most people come to Rust because of the unique combination of first two pillars, Performance & Control with Reliability & Safety. In most languages today you have to choose one or the other. Languages like JavaScript Kotlin and Java have compile time or runtime prevention of threading or memory corruption issues, but they abstract away your access to the machine. On the other side the C family of languages provides that access but little in the way of safeguards. So increasingly projects needs both of those.
